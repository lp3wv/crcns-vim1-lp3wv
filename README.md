For further analysis, I want to look at how the BOLD responses creates patterns of responses and investigate how these patterns vary across different brain regions.   

To download data set:

https://portal.nersc.gov/project/crcns/download/index.php

To load data, download EstimatedResponses.mat and Stimuli_Val_FullRes.mat into folder and update file location in code, in 'fullFile' variable

To run code, must have pytables and h5py packages installed in environment.
